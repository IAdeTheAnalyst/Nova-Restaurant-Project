# 🛒 Instacart Orders Project — PostgreSQL Data Analysis

This project analyzes grocery shopping behavior using Instacart’s transaction data. PostgreSQL was used to uncover patterns in product reordering, basket composition, and customer retention. The project highlights SQL techniques for behavioral segmentation, product association, and time-based purchase analysis to support marketing strategy and inventory optimization.

## 📊 Project Overview

**Goal**: Explore customer shopping habits to identify high-frequency items, popular reorder combinations, and timing of grocery purchases.  
**Dataset**: Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset (from Kaggle)  
**Tools Used**: PostgreSQL, SQL (JOINs, window functions, subqueries, CASE, ARRAY_AGG, COUNT, FILTER, etc.)

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

- Which products are reordered most frequently?
- What product combinations often appear in the same cart?
- How often do customers return to place a new order?
- What are the most active days and hours for online grocery shopping?
- Which users demonstrate the most consistent ordering patterns?

---

## 🛠 Techniques & Concepts

- **JOINs** across multiple tables (products, orders, departments, aisles)
- **Window functions** to rank top users and time gaps between orders
- **ARRAY_AGG + FILTER** to detect product pairings in shared baskets
- **CASE statements** for segmenting reorder behavior
- **CTEs & subqueries** for layered analysis and intermediate steps

## 📈 Insights & Outcomes

- Over 50% of products were reordered regularly, with bananas and organic eggs ranking highest
- Specific item combinations like chips and salsa, or milk and cereal, frequently co-occurred in carts
- Top users ordered weekly, while average customers returned every ~15 days
- Sundays and early evenings saw the highest order volume, guiding campaign timing and fulfillment planning
